I am an undergraduate student majoring in Assistive Devices and Rehabilitation Engineering at Zhejiang Pharmaceutical University. I am currently a research intern at the Ningbo Institute of Materials Technology and Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences ，CAS.
My research interests focus on biomedical signal processing and data-driven modeling, with particular emphasis on EEG-based cognitive impairment analysis and speech signal processing. I have been involved in projects related to non-stationary signal analysis, multidimensional feature extraction, and deep learning methods for biomedical applications.
I am interested in combining signal processing techniques with modern deep learning frameworks to address real-world problems in medical and health-related domains, and I am actively seeking opportunities for further research training and graduate study.
